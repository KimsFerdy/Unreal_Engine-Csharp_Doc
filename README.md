# Unreal Scripting

#### _Unreal Engine, scripted properly._

**UnrealScripting** is a focused, production-grade guide to building Unreal Engine projects using **C# as the primary language**, with **Blueprints as a first-class companion**.

No demos.\
No toy examples.\
No half-explained engine concepts.

Just **clear rules**, **real patterns**, and **usable knowledge**.

***

### Why UnrealScripting Exists

Unreal Engine documentation is scattered, inconsistent, and often unclear — especially if you want to write **real gameplay code** without drowning in C++.

UnrealScripting fixes that by:

* Treating **C# as a serious Unreal language**
* Using **Blueprints where they make sense**
* Explaining **what Unreal assets actually do**
* Showing **how systems fit together**, not just how they compile

***

### The Philosophy

#### C# — Gameplay & Systems

* Core game logic
* Runtime systems
* Tools & utilities
* Non-game Unreal applications

> If you’re coming from Unity, this is your home.

***

#### Blueprints — Data & Orchestration

* Designer-friendly logic
* Fast iteration
* Asset configuration
* Visual control flow

> Blueprints are powerful when used **intentionally**, not everywhere.

### What You’ll Find Here

* **Complete UAsset explanations**\
  What they are, when to use them, and how to reference them safely.
* **Unity-style documentation**\
  Consistent structure. Searchable. Deep — not shallow.
* **Hybrid C# / BP architecture**\
  Clean boundaries, real patterns, scalable projects.
* **Math, engine data types, and fundamentals**\
  Explained the way Unreal actually works.
* **Templates & reference projects**\
  Built for reuse, not screenshots.

***

### Who This Is For

UnrealScripting is for developers who:

* Want **C# in Unreal**, done properly
* Use Blueprints but hate spaghetti
* Care about structure, not hacks
* Want to **build**, not fight the engine

If you want hype or beginner hand-holding — this isn’t it.

#### Unreal isn’t hard.

#### It’s just badly explained.
